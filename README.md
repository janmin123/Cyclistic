## Project Background
### About the company Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a bike-share program, in Chicago, that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day. 

### Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Ask
### Business Task
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 

### Stakeholders
* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels
* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program. 

### Guiding Questions
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? 

Moreno has assigned me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes?

## Prepare
### Data Source
* Cyclistic’s [historical trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from Sep 2023 to Aug 2024 will be used to analyze and identify trends 
* The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
* This is public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. Data-privacy issues prohibits the usage of riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes. 

### Data Organization
There are 12 monthly csv files and each includes information on ride id, ride type, start time, end time, start station name, start station id, end station name, end station id, start gps location, end gps location and rider’s membership type. 

## Process
BigQuery is selected as the platform to manage and analyze the data. This is because Microsoft Excel spreadsheet has a row limit of 1,048,576 rows and a column limit of 16,384 columns and is unable to handle large datasets such as Cyclistic dataset which has 5.6 millions rows.

### Data Combination
* As the Free Plan on BigQuery limits 100MB per upload, the 12 CSV files (which is larger than 100MB each) are first uploaded in Google Cloud Storage before being uploaded as tables in the dataset `cyclistic_data`.
* The 12 CSV files are combined into the data table `cyclistic_12months_data` and contains 5699639 rows.

### Data Exploration
* Null Values
  * Observed 968697 rows of null values for start_station_name
  * Observed 968697 rows of null values for start_station_id
    * Checked that both start_station_name and start_station_id null values occur at the same row
  * Observed 1006133 rows of null values for end_station_name
  * Observed 1006133 rows of null values for end_station_id
    * Checked that both end_station_name and end_station_id  null values occur at the same row
    * Checked that 472808 rows contain null values for start and end_station_name and start and end_station_id
  * Observed 7526 rows of null values for end_lat
  * Observed 7526 rows of null values for end_lng
    * Checked that both end_lat and end_lng  null values occur at the same row

* Average trip duration in a day
  * The trip duration for casual riders tend to dip at around 3-5am  on bounces back only from 8am.
  * The trip duration for members also remain consistent throughout without any significant changes.

* Average trip duration in a week
  * The trip duration for casual riders gradually increases from Friday till Sunday
  * The trip duration for members also remain consistent on weekdays before picking up slightly from Fridays till Sunday.

* Average trip duration in a month
  * The trip duration remains fairly consistent across all riders

* Average trip duration in a year
  * The trip duration for casual riders sees a dip from October onwards before picking up gradually in January.
  * The trip duration for members also remain consistent throughout without any significant changes.

From the data above, we can hypothesize that
1) Members are likely using the bikes for commuting to and from their workplace, residential area and possibly schools. This can be seen from the **spike in trip count during peak hours in the morning and evening**, **coupled with the decrease in trip count on the weekends when there is no work or school**.
2) Casual riders are likely using the bikes for leisure purposes such as touring or sightseeing . This can be observed from the 
**gradual increase in trip count throughout the day until 5pm where the usage decreases after 5pm which is the closing hours of most places of attraction**,
**significant increase (~2x) in trip counts on the weekends**,
**gradual increase in average trip duration on the weekends**.
3) Both members and casual riders observe a dip in trip counts during colder months from October till January. However, the cycle duration for members remain consistent while casual riders are observed to cycle for a shorter duration during this period. This further supports the hypothesis that members are using the bikes for commuting while casual riders are using the bikes for more ad hoc and leisure purposes

To further confirm the findings above, we look at the geographical data of the trips taken by the riders

* Casual riders are observed to start and end their trip near the coastal areas while members are relatively spread out across the Chicago’s city center. 
  * The casual riders are likely using the bikes for sightseeing and touring as most of Chicago’s places of attraction are located near the coastal areas, for instance the Navy Pier, 360 Chicago, Museum of Contemporary Art and Millennium Park just to name a few.
  * The member riders are likely using the bikes for commuting as most trip locations are spread out across the city center where the offices, schools and residential areas are located.

* Both rider type see most of the rides contained within the city center and starts to decrease the further it is from the center. This may suggest that bikes may be more popular and purposeful within the urban area where facilities and amenities are nearer to each other and more interconnected since the average ride duration for both riders range from maximum 15 to 30 minutes. However, this needs to be further validated with more data.
